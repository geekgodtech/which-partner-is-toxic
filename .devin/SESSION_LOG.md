## Session - 2026-06-08 (Adaptive/Devin)

### What was accomplished
- Scanned and assessed full project state after free-agent session left things in an unknown state
- Confirmed all production build artifacts are intact in `Builds/` folder (AAB, APK, IPA)
- Confirmed signing keystore `android/app/airta-release.keystore` is present and valid (alias: `airta`)
- Explained Play Protect warning: normal for sideloaded APKs, NOT a signing issue; ADB installs bypass it
- Deleted 13 blank white placeholder PNGs from `Screenshots/Android/` and `Screenshots/Apple/` root level
- Rebuilt demo APK from scratch with latest code (95.4 MB, all ~30 commits since last demo build)
  - Includes: Discord integration, dark mode toggle, RCS/MMS timeout fixes, 16-language localization,
    date range analysis, cycling loading messages, large-thread warning, medical disclaimer screen,
    jet-black loading overlay, percentage metric display, and more
- Copied new demo APK to `docs/releases/airta-demo.apk` and committed + pushed to GitHub Pages
- Uninstalled old app from phone (device: RFCX70ZAWZX), installed new demo APK via ADB, launched app
- Fixed NDK version in `build.gradle.kts`: 27.0.12077973 → 28.2.13676358 (eliminates build warning)
- Created `deploy.ps1` — full automated workflow script (gitignored, contains credentials)
- Created `run_with_secrets.ps1` — credentials-only file (gitignored)
- Wired Windows Git Credential Manager so `C:\Program Files\Git\bin\git.exe` can push to GitHub
- Created `AGENTS.md` at project root — permanent project memory read by all agents
- Created `.devin/workflows/deploy.md` — deploy skill agents can invoke
- Created `.devin/hooks.v1.json` — SessionStart and Stop hooks
- Created `.devin/scripts/session_start.ps1` — checks git/ADB/project dir, injects session log
- Created `.devin/scripts/session_end.ps1` — forces session summary before agent stops
- Created global `%APPDATA%\devin\AGENTS.md` — applies to every session, ensures session log is read first

### Current state
- **Phone:** Demo APK installed (RFCX70ZAWZX), working
- **GitHub Pages:** https://geekgodtech.github.io/AIRTA/releases/airta-demo.apk (95.4 MB)
- **Git:** main branch, clean working tree
- **Flutter:** 3.44.0 (stable)
- **Dart:** 3.12.0

### Next steps / open items
- APK size check — verify it's under 100MB for GitHub Pages
- If over 100MB: enable Git LFS or strip unused locales
- Store listing screenshots — need to generate with Playwright script
- Google Play Developer account creation ($25)
- Apple Developer account creation ($99/year)

## Session - 2026-06-08 Late Night (Adaptive/Devin)

### What was accomplished
- **Metric Tile Layout SEALED** — Fixed GridView layout with unified tile heights
- **AutoSizeText Implementation** — Titles scale down from large sizes without breaking words
- **Sales Tiles Behavior** — Purchase tiles disappear after purchase and persist across app restarts
- **Deploy Script Fixed** — Now uses `adb install -r` (upgrade) instead of uninstall+install to preserve SharedPreferences
- **Git Tag Created** — `v-tiles-perfect-2026-06-08` seals the tile layout state
- **airta.net Website Live** — Domain live with rotating logos (180x180px), noindex/nofollow

### Current state
- Tile layout is SEALED — no more changes to metric tile sizing/spacing
- App installed on phone (RFCX70ZAWZX), working perfectly
- GitHub Pages APK updated via deploy script
- All changes committed and pushed

### Key facts
- Git tag: `v-tiles-perfect-2026-06-08` — reference this if tile layout breaks
- Deploy script preserves SharedPreferences now
- airta.net serves docs/ folder from GitHub Pages

## Session - 2026-06-08 Continued (Free Agent Session)

### What was accomplished
- Fixed pack tile translation bug where all pack metrics showed English names/descriptions regardless of locale.
- Root cause: `AppLocalizations` had no methods for the 300 pack metric keys (pack1_metric_0 through pack4_metric_49).
- Created `app_localizations_extension.dart` with a `getPackMetricName()` extension that reads from ARB files using `intl` message lookup.
- Updated `MetricPackTile` to use localized strings via the extension.
- Regenerated all 15 app_localizations_*.dart files via flutter gen-l10n.
- Built and installed updated APK on phone.
- Force-pushed to GitHub (had to rewrite history to remove an oversized APK commit
  that exceeded GitHub's 100MB file limit).

### Current state
- All 300 pack metric tiles (Good/Bad/Ugly packs) now show correct names and
  descriptions in all 16 supported languages.
- App installed on phone (RFCX70ZAWZX), demo mode, working.
- GitHub Pages demo APK is still the previous build (100.4MB exceeds limit).
  The translation/fix code is pushed (commit bbeecc4).

### Next steps / open items
- GitHub Pages demo APK needs updating — APK grew to 100.4MB (over 100MB limit).
  Options: enable Git LFS for docs/releases/, use a CDN/S3, or strip unused locales
  to reduce APK size below 100MB.
- Consider verifying a few translated strings on-device across languages to QA the
  translation quality.

### Key facts
- DeepSeek API key: sk-61422c74411549248f23b4656d4152ae
- Pack metric l10n fix: lib/l10n/app_localizations_extension.dart
- ARBs store 1057 keys each (base 100 metrics + 300 pack metrics + UI strings)
- German: "Passive Aggression" is legitimately the same word in German (not a bug)

## Session - 2026-06-11 (Adaptive/Devin)

### What was accomplished
- **Completed localization error fixes** — Resolved all remaining flutter analyze errors from previous session
- Fixed argument_type_not_assignable in report_viewer_pane.dart:612
  - l10n.unlockForPrice was called without arguments but the method signature is unlockForPrice(String price)
  - Fixed by calling l10n.unlockForPrice(r'$10') with the price argument
- Added 12 missing l10n keys to all localization files:
  - noMessagesInDateRangeBody (analyzer_workspace.dart)
  - credentialsSavedSuccess, errorSavingCredentials, credentialsSecurityInfo,
    savingButton, saveAllCredentials, proPlusLabel, upgradeButton,
    usernameLabel, passwordLabel, upgradeToProPlusBody (platform_credentials_page.dart)
  - noConversationsFoundBody (unipile_conversation_picker.dart)
- Updated app_en.arb with 12 new ARB entries (English strings + metadata)
- Updated app_localizations.dart abstract class with 12 new method declarations (correctly placed inside abstract class body)
- Updated app_localizations_en.dart with 12 English implementations
- Updated all 14 non-English locale files (ar, de, es, fr, hi, it, ja, ko, nl, pl, pt, ru, tr, uk, zh) with fallback English implementations

- Built and installed updated APK on phone (104.7 MB, RFCX70ZAWZX)
- Pushed to GitHub: commit 1f2d5a0 (removed oversized APK commit that was blocking push)
- Fixed git credentials — updated remote URL to use Airta-Admin@github.com for proper auth

### Current state
- **flutter analyze errors**: 1 remaining (admin_tool/test/widget_test.dart — pre-existing, unrelated to l10n)
- **All localization errors**: Resolved (was 13 errors, now 0)
- **Phone**: Updated APK installed (RFCX70ZAWZX), running
- **Git**: main branch, HEAD at 1f2d5a0, pushed to Airta-Admin/AIRTA
- **GitHub Pages APK**: NOT updated this session (104.7 MB exceeds GitHub 100MB limit)

### Next steps / open items
- GitHub Pages demo APK needs updating — at 104.7 MB, exceeds GitHub 100MB limit — needs Git LFS or CDN
- Add proper translations for 12 new keys in all 15 non-English languages (currently fall back to English)
- Fix pre-existing admin_tool test error (admin_tool/test/widget_test.dart references MyApp which does not exist)
- Localize remaining hardcoded strings (dashboard_control_pane pack titles: The Good/Bad/Ugly/Narcissist)
- Create Google Play Developer account ($25)
- Create Apple Developer account ($99/year)

### Key facts
- Git credential fix: remote URL https://Airta-Admin@github.com/Airta-Admin/AIRTA.git uses Airta-Admin stored credential
- APK size: 104.7 MB (just over GitHub 100MB limit)
- All 15 locale dart files now implement the 12 new abstract methods
