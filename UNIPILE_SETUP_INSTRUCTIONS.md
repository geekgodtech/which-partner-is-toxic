# Unipile Integration Setup Instructions

## What You Need from Unipile (9am Tomorrow)

When you speak with Unipile tomorrow, you need to get:

1. **API URL** - Format: `https://apiXXX.unipile.com:XXX`
   - This is your dedicated Unipile API endpoint
   - Example: `https://api22.unipile.com:15260`

2. **API Key** - Format: A long string starting with letters/numbers
   - This authenticates your requests to Unipile
   - Keep this secret and secure

## Your Use Case to Discuss with Unipile

**App**: Which Partner is Toxic - Relationship Communication Analyzer

**Use Case**: 
- Users need to import chat conversations from multiple platforms (WhatsApp, Discord, Telegram, Instagram, Messenger, etc.)
- Pro tier ($19.99/month): Access to import from any messaging platform
- Pro Plus tier ($24.99/month): Same as Pro + Discord community access
- We need to fetch chat history and messages for analysis

**Integration Method**: Hosted Auth Wizard
- Users click "From File" button in the app
- They're redirected to Unipile's hosted auth page
- They authenticate with their messaging platform
- We fetch their chat conversations and messages via API
- We analyze the conversations for relationship toxicity

**Expected Volume**: 
- Starting small, scaling as user base grows
- Need to understand pricing tiers and rate limits

## How to Configure After You Get Credentials

### Step 1: Add Credentials to Build Command

**IMPORTANT**: Never commit API keys to Git! Use `--dart-define` to pass them securely.

When you get your Unipile credentials, build the APK with:

```bash
flutter build apk --release \
  --dart-define=DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=YOUR_DEEPSEEK_API_KEY_FROM_SECRETS_ENV \
  --dart-define=UNIPILE_API_URL=https://apiXXX.unipile.com:XXX/api/v1 \
  --dart-define=UNIPILE_API_KEY=your_actual_unipile_api_key_here
```

**Example** (replace with your actual values):
```bash
flutter build apk --release \
  --dart-define=DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=YOUR_DEEPSEEK_API_KEY_FROM_SECRETS_ENV \
  --dart-define=UNIPILE_API_URL=https://api22.unipile.com:15260/api/v1 \
  --dart-define=UNIPILE_API_KEY=unipile_abc123xyz456
```

### Step 2: Test the Integration

1. Build APK with the command above (including your Unipile credentials)

2. Install on your device

3. Use the debug gesture to set Pro membership:
   - Long press "Select" for 1 second

4. Click "From File" button

5. You should see the Unipile auth wizard load

6. Connect a messaging account (WhatsApp, Discord, etc.)

7. Select a conversation to analyze
