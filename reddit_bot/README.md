# AIRTA Reddit Monitor

Monitors Reddit in real-time for relationship-strife posts that match your target criteria.
When a match is found it emails you at `geekgodtech@gmail.com` with:
- The post title, author, URL, and first 1000 characters
- A pre-composed, personalized reply draft ready to copy-paste into Reddit
- A relevance score (0–10) based on keyword density

**This bot never posts automatically.** You review every alert and reply manually.
That keeps it policy-compliant and protects your brand reputation.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `python main.py` | Start the live Reddit stream monitor |
| `python main.py --stats` | Show total posts seen, alerts sent, replies logged |
| `python main.py --check-votes` | Check current upvote scores on all your logged replies |
| `python main.py --log-reply <post_id> <comment_id>` | Log a reply you manually posted |

### Logging a reply
After you manually reply to a Reddit post, log it so the vote monitor can track it:
```bash
python main.py --log-reply abc123 def456
# post_id is the Reddit post ID (last part of URL before comments/)
# comment_id is your comment's ID (visible in the comment's permalink)
```

## How it works

1. **Streams** new posts from target subreddits in real-time
2. **Filters** by:
   - Minimum body length (300 chars) — avoids low-quality posts
   - Maximum post age (2 hours) — only fresh posts worth replying to
   - Relevance score ≥ 5/10 — must match relationship AND toxicity keywords
3. **Rate limits** to max 10 alerts/day and 2-hour cooldown per subreddit
4. **Sends email** with post content + rotating pre-composed reply draft
5. **Tracks everything** in `reddit_tracking.json` and `replied_posts.json` so restarts don't cause duplicates

## Relevance scoring

| Keyword type | Points each |
|---|---|
| Strong relationship word (partner, husband, wife...) | +2 |
| Weak relationship word (dating, SO, ex...) | +1 |
| Strong toxicity word (gaslighting, narcissist, coercive...) | +3 |
| Weak toxicity word (toxic, red flag, jealous...) | +1 |

Minimum score to trigger alert: **5/10**
